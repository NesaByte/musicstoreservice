The application was built from scratch mainly using Spring Boot and Angular. There are three roles: User, admin and stuff. The Customer can be a user or stuff and admin does the CRUD operations for the user. For the music management, admin and stuff can do the CRUD operations for music like adding and deleting music. Only audited music can be uploaded to the server and shown to the customer for sale. The customers can see the music list without login and then preview it for 30s before they add it to cart and buy.
